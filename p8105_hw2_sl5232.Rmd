## Problem 1

Import data from `NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv`. Then clean variable names and selects the interested column of variables. Using the `recode()` argument to change the entry variable from `YES` / `NO` to a logical variable. Also change the route 8-11 data type from double to character as the route 1-7 data.

```{r }
Transit_df = 
  read_csv(
    "data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```



```{r}

```
