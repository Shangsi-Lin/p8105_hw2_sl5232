```

## Problem 1

Import data from `NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv`. Then
clean variable names and selects the interested column of variables.
Using the `recode()` argument to change the entry variable from `YES` /
`NO` to a logical variable. Also change the route 8-11 data type from
double to character as the route 1-7 data.

``` r
Transit_df = 
  read_csv(
    "data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

These data are not tidy, after the cleaning above, the current dataset
contains variables including line, station name, station latitude,
station longitude, route information, entry, exit only or not, vending,
entrance type, and ADA compliance. The dataset dimension is 1868 x 20.
It would be helpful to change rount numbers and route as variables for
investigations interested on specific routes.

To find out the number of unique stations, select station name and line
and use `distinct()` to find all unique combinations that each
represents a unique station. The number of rows represent the number of
unique stations.

``` r
Transit_df %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 × 2
    ##    station_name             line    
    ##    <chr>                    <chr>   
    ##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
    ##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
    ## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
    ## # … with 455 more rows

Turns out, there are 465 unique stations.

To find out the number of ADA compliant stations, filter `ada == TRUE`
first and then select unique stations the same as before. The number of
rows represent the number of ADA compliant stations.

``` r
Transit_df %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 84 × 2
    ##    station_name                   line           
    ##    <chr>                          <chr>          
    ##  1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       4 Avenue       
    ##  2 DeKalb Av                      4 Avenue       
    ##  3 Pacific St                     4 Avenue       
    ##  4 Grand Central                  42nd St Shuttle
    ##  5 34th St                        6 Avenue       
    ##  6 47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center 6 Avenue       
    ##  7 Church Av                      6 Avenue       
    ##  8 21st St                        63rd Street    
    ##  9 Lexington Av                   63rd Street    
    ## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
    ## # … with 74 more rows

Turns out, there are 84 ADA compliant stations.

To find out the proportion of station entrances / exits without vending
allow entrance, first filter stations that don’t allow vending, and then
take the mean of the `entry` variable. The result is the parameter of
interest.

``` r
Transit_df %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

Turns out, the proportion of station entrances / exits without vending
allow entrance is about 0.377
